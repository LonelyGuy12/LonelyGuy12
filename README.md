# 💖 Lonely Guy – My Smol README  

Hiii~! Welcome to my tiny lil’ corner of the internet... ପ(๑•ᴗ•๑)ଓ ♡  

![blushing anime boy](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSVC-JRgq2KngHMy29BSjSpE1VdGU2GFWuyfCqKKwReJzzN4K8XzH0hZfd3-DXRFUWlXGU&usqp=CAU)  

Just a lonely guy whispering sweet nothings to my code and hoping it loves me back.  
Most of the time, I’m just searching for the semicolon to my statement... maybe that’s you? 🥺👉👈  

My code’s love language is **words of affirmation**, so pwease be kind to it!

## ✨ Cheesy Lines I Actually Use  

- You must be a 404 error... ❤️  
  Because I’ve been searching everywhere for someone like you.  
- Are you a keyboard? Because you’re just my type. ⌨️  
- My love for you is like `while(true)` — endless. ♾️  
- Are you git? Because I’m totally committed to you. 🔒  
- I think we’d be a `pair<T, U>`… perfect combo! 😉
